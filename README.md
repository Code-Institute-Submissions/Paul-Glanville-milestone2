## Purpose of project
The purpose with the creation of the project is to create a memory game with 16 Tiles from 1 - 16 and number as such. 
The finished product should allow the user to view a sequence with increasing difficulty levels as the user succeeds with each win of a round.
after a sequence is played the user will then be required to click on the same tiles in the sequence presented for each round.


---

## Function

### Star Button - when clicked will start the game at level 1 
### Tiles/ Numbered Boxes - should light up in sequence after a few seconds once the start button has been clicked, and once the sequence to each round has played the user is then to click on each tile in the order in which they have seen and can remember for that specific round/level.
### Round Counter - Displays each level/Round that the user is currently on  but will refresh to 1 if the user does not successfully click the tiles in order.
### dialogue box to display either the success or failure of each round.
